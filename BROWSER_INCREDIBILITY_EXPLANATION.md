# Browser Incognito Mode Explanation

## What is Incognito/Private Browsing?
- Incognito (Chrome) or Private (Firefox/Safari) browsing is a browser feature
- It doesn't save browsing history, cookies, or site data
- It helps test websites without cached data interfering

## How to Open Incognito/Private Window:
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)
- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac)
- Safari: Cmd+Shift+N

## Why I Mentioned It
When I suggested trying "incognito," I meant:
- Open an incognito/private browser window
- Visit your site: https://full-stack-todo-app-wemu.vercel.app/
- This helps rule out browser cache issues

## Not a Deployment Method
Incognito is NOT a deployment method - it's just a browser feature to test websites without cached data affecting the experience.

## Current Status
Your project is already deployed on Vercel. The issue is likely:
1. Propagation delay (wait 5-10 minutes)
2. Browser cache (try incognito/private window)
3. Incorrect URL (make sure you're visiting the root URL)

## Next Steps
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for full deployment propagation
2. Try accessing your site in an incognito/private browser window
3. Make sure you're visiting: https://full-stack-todo-app-wemu.vercel.app/
